# Paytrail Javascript SDK

The goal for this project is to develop a Javascript SDK for the Paytrail payment service. The aim is to provide JS developers with an easier and more streamlined way to integrate our API into their applications.

The initial version of the JS SDK will be focused on basic payment handling and backend usage, specifically enabling communication with the [Paytrail payment API](https://docs.paytrail.com/#/). As such, it will not include any frontend functionalities, similar to the [Paytrail PHP-SDK](https://github.com/paytrail/paytrail-php-sdk). However, we may provide examples for frontend implementation at a later stage.

Stay tuned.
